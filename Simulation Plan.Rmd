* Number of Covariates: 2 settings: p=10/20
* Number of Responses: 2 settings: q = 3/6
* Sample Size for Training Data: $N_{train}$ = 400/800
* Sample Size for Testing Data: $N_{test}$ = 1000
* Number of Iteration: 1000
* Covariance Matrix for Covariates: $\Sigma = \mathbb{I}/AR(0.8)$
* Variations:
  + pre-treatment covariates $X^b$: Doesn't matter that much? TODO: Linking back with CCA
  + Post-treatment covariates $X^e$: matters
  + Linking error, i.e. x -> y: matters
* Treatment effect function: TODO: selection of the following functions considering the CCA setting
  + one-to-one:
  + Multiple-to-one:
  + Multiple-to-multiple:
  + function :
    - linear
    - non-linear
* Link function:
  + Linear: Linear Design Matrix
  + Non-Linear: Element wise square design matrix?

    
* Metrics Evaluated
  + Treatment Effect (\& its variance): TODO: come up with a measure of uncertainty, variance is the best bet
  \[ \mathbb{E}(Y^e|T=1) - \mathbb{E}(Y^e|T=-1)\]
  + Treatment Recommendation: The reason that I would like to see something about it is because, at the end, we would like to apply this in a real life scenario where the recommendation are given.
  \[\mathbb{1}(w\mathbb{E}(Y^e|T=1) - w\mathbb{E}(Y^e|T=-1))\]
